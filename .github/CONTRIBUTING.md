# Contributing to mini-antui

The following is a set of guidelines for contributing to ``mini-antui``. Please spend several minutes in reading these guidelines before you create an issue or pull request.

Anyway, these are just guidelines, not rules, use your best judgment and feel free to propose changes to this document in a pull request.


## Do your homework before asking a question

It's a great idea to read Eric Steven Raymond's [How To Ask Questions The Smart Way](http://www.catb.org/esr/faqs/smart-questions.html) twice before asking a question. But if you are busy now, I recommend to read [Don't post homework questions](http://www.catb.org/esr/faqs/smart-questions.html#homework) first.

The following guidelines are about *How to avoid Homework Questions*.

### 1. Read the documentation.

It sad but true that someone just glance(not read) [mini-antui's documentation](https://docs.alipay.com/mini/component-ext/overview-ext-common). Please read the documentation closely.

### 2. Read the FAQ and search the issues list of mini-antui

Your questions may be asked and solved by others. So please spend several minutes on searching. Remember [DRY](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Don%27t_repeat_yourself), both code and questions.

## Close your issue if it's solved

It is a good habit which will save maintainers' time. Thank you!

## Providing a demo while reporting a bug

It would be helpful to provide a demo which can re-produce the bug 100%. Please give us the steps in detail that can help us re-producing the bug you met. Then, create an issue. The most important thing is: double check before claiming that you have found a bug.

## Tips about Feature Request

If you believe that ``mini-antui`` should provide some features, but it does not. You could create an issue to discuss.

## Tips about Pull Request

It's welcomed to pull request. And there are some tips about that:

1. It is a good habit to create a feature request issue to disscuss whether the feature is necessary before you implement it. However, it's unnecessary to create an issue to claim that you found a typo or improved the readability of documentaion, just create a pull request.
2. Rebase before creating a PR to keep commit history clear.
3. Add some descriptions and refer relative issues for you PR.
